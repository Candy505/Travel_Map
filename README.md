1) The application is built using a full-stack approach, utilizing MongoDB for seamless data storage, Express for robust backend functionality, and React for creating an interactive and user-friendly frontend interface. 

2) I encourage collaboration, so feel free to contribute to the project by addressing issues or suggesting enhancements. Let's embark on a journey of sharing travel experiences with the world!

3) React Leaflet is used for creating map container. While it was a new journey for me exploring this on my own, it was a rewarding experience.
